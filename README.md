# Percolation
Estimate the percolation threshold of an n-by-n grid with Monte Carlo simulation. Run simulation multiple times, compute and display mean, std. dev., etc.

This project is from the Princeton course COS226. All files were given except Percolation.java and PercolationStats.java, which I created.
